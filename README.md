# :rocket: Module 3 Project
__________________________________________________________________

## Overview
This project will emphasize tasks learned in Module 3 that focus on utilizing Git version control and managing the Python environments. The culmination of the project will be the handling of various data types. 

 ## :sparkler:   Deliverables
* GitHub Repository: datafun-03-analytics
* Documentation: README.md
* Script: jballard_analytics.py

## External Dependencies
* requests

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Version Control 
* Git Add to all the changes to the staging area
* Git Commit to push the changes to the remote repo. Be sure to add a comment detailing the reason for the commit.  A good habit to have.
* Git Push 



## Objectives 


## Build process :factory:

### :one: Step 1:Terminal work
* Using Git Bash terminal, I setup the environment. Beginning with the project folder, then the virtual environment.
* I used the command " python -m venv .venv" then activated the virtual environment "source .venv/scripts/activate" which is different than the instruction in Module 3 material.  I had to do some research to determine what I was doing wrong.
* The Python Standard Library components need installed utilizing the "pip -m install" command.  I wanted to know want the significance of the "-m" flag was so I researched to find out the reason and cause for the Professor to make a note about leaving it out.  The -m flag ensures you are using the module in the correct environment.  In essence I see that it is to ensure consistency of programming.
* Create and freeze the "requirements.txt" to provide file that outlines the packages used for the project.
* Create the ".gitignore" file as a place to store the mass of material not required to transit back and forth between the local and remote repos.

### :two:  Step 2: IDE: VS Code
* Provide a quick description of the project. Remember to comment the description out with either the """-""" or :hash:
* I like to outline the project with the sections that will require my coding. Again using the technique to comment out the narrative.
* Import the Dependencies
    Standard Library 
        * csv
        * pathlib
    External Library 
        *requests
    Local module imports
        * use previous modules (1 & 2) 

### :three: Step 3. Data Acquisition

The data cquisiton was the hardest part of the project- pnce I had the idea of what was input and what was output ( I named my files that way) it was easier.

### :four: Step 4. Write Data
Gaing a better understanding of the process helped me correct the errors and postional arguments.  THe textbook and material are good resources, just take multiple times to understand the concept.

### :five: Step 5. Data Analysis output
Understanding what the code was doing mad the biggest differnce in this part of the process. I found that by naming the output file and input file made my understanding of the process easier.

### :six: Step 6. Exception Handling
I am interested to find out how to make this function for the whole project across multiple data types.  Once I figure this out I will make this boilplate code that I include (with specific modifications) in all of my projects.

### :seven: Step 7. Main Function
The main function is still lost on me- I will need to gain a better understanding of the main() and how it plays into the code.

### :eight: Step 8. Conditional Script Execution

## :eight_pointed_black_star: Evaluation Criteria
* Functionality
* Documentation
* Presentation
* Professionalism
